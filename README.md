# Note
This project has not been updated in the last year and does not work with the current version of quivr because of the huge api changes.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run the Quivr React Native Client:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iMADi-ARCH/quivr-mobile.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd quivr-mobile
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

4. Set environment variables: Change the variables inside `.envrc.example` file with your own.

   a. **Option A**: Using `direnv`

   1. Install direnv - https://direnv.net/#getting-started
   2. Copy `.envrc.example` to `.envrc`

      ```bash
      cp .envrc.example .envrc
      ```

   3. Allow reading `.envrc`
      ```bash
      direnv allow .
      ```

   b. **Option B**: Set system wide environment variables by copying the content of `.envrc` and placing it at the bottom of your shell file e.g. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

5. Configure the backend API endpoints:
   Open the `config.ts` file and update the `BACKEND_PORT` and `PROD_BACKEND_DOMAIN` constants with the appropriate values corresponding to your Quivr backend.

6. Run the application:

```bash
yarn expo start
```

Then you can press `a` to run the app on an android emulator (given you already have Android studio setup)
